Chiricahua National Monument
State(s): AZ

Description:
Explore rhyolite pinnacles and balanced rocks on foot or by car. Relax at the campground under star-filled, dark skies. See how a mountain range rising between two deserts creates a home for diverse wildlife. Imagine history here. Prehistoric peoples, Apaches, Buffalo Soldiers, Civilian Conservation Corps, ranchers, and homesteaders inhabited Chiricahua.
