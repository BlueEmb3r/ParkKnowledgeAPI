Chamizal National Memorial
State(s): TX

Description:
Chamizal is more than just an urban park to recreate or enjoy a quiet afternoon. These grounds are a reminder of the harmonious settlement of a 100-year boundary dispute between the United States and Mexico. We celebrate the cultures of the borderlands to promote the same mutual respect that helped to diplomatically resolve an international disagreement.

Directions:
Chamizal National Memorial is located in a large, bi-national metropolitan area and easily accessible by road. El Paso International Airport is nearby, as well as an Amtrack train station.

Operating Hours:
Entrance Gates and Memorial Grounds: The Memorial grounds are open to vehicle and foot traffic only when the gates are open.

Weather:
Chamizal National Memorial is open year-round, but periodic winter weather conditions may cause closure. Please check for alerts on the park website: www.nps.gov/cham. Thunderstorms typically occur during summer and early fall. There may be no shelter to avoid lightning, so please prepare by looking at weather forecasts and paying attention to developing weather conditions.
