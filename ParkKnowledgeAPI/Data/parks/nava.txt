Navajo National Monument
State(s): AZ

Description:
For centuries, the Hopi, San Juan Southern Paiute, Zuni, and Navajo people have lived in the canyons. Springs fed farmlands on the canyon floor and homes were built in the natural sandstone alcoves. The cliff dwellings of Betatakin, Keet Seel, and Inscription House were last physically occupied around 1300 AD but the villages have a spiritual presence that can still be felt today.
