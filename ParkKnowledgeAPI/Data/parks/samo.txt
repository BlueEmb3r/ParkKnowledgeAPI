The park abounds with historical and cultural sites, from old movie ranches to Native American centers. What will you and your family discover?

The Santa Monica Mountains are traversed by the 405 Freeway on the east side; crowned by the 101 Freeway on the north and west side; and Highway 1, the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), on the southern ocean border.
