Conceived in 1921, built by private citizens, and completed in 1937, today the trail is managed by the National Park Service, US Forest Service, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, numerous state agencies and thousands of volunteers.

Directions:
There are many points of access along the Appalachian Trail, whether it is by car, train, bus or plane. For more detailed directions, please refer to the "Directions" section of our park webpage.

Operating Hours:
Appalachian National Scenic Trail: In general, the Appalachian Trail is open year-round. The northern terminus at Mount Katahdin in Maine is within Baxter State Park, which may be closed in winter months, depending on weather conditions. 
Particular sections of the Trail, and less-developed roads accessing the Trail, may be closed temporarily for a number of reasons, but otherwise the trail is open.

Weather:
It is your responsibility to be prepared for all weather conditions, including extreme and unexpected weather changes year-round. As the trail runs from Georgia to Maine there will be different weather conditions depending on your location.
