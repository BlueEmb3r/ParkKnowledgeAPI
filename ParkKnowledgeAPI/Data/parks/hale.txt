Directions:
Located on the island of Maui, Haleakalā National Park extends from the 10,023 foot (3055m) summit of Haleakalā down the southeast flank of the mountain to the Kīpahulu coast near Hana. These two sections of the park are not directly connected by road, but both can be reached from Kahului. There are no gas stations within the park.

Operating Hours:
Operating Hours: The Summit and Kīpahulu Districts of Haleakalā are open 24 hours a day. A sunrise reservation is required for entry between 3am and 7am daily.

Weather:
On any given day, the temperatures in the park can range from a high of 80°F (27°C) in Kīpahulu to a low of 30°F (-1°C) at the summit. In either area clouds and rain can quickly replace warm sunshine. Weather in the high-elevation summit and wilderness areas of the park is highly unpredictable and changes often. Cool temperatures, intense solar radiation, and rapidly moving clouds are characteristic. On average, the temperature drops about 3°F for every 1,000 foot rise in elevation.
