Canyon de Chelly National Monument
State(s): AZ

Description:
This canyon is home to Diné families who raise livestock, grow crops and live here. People have lived in these canyons for nearly 5,000 years, which is longer than anyone has lived continuously on the Colorado Plateau. In this place called Tsegi, their homes and images tell us their stories. Today, the park and Navajo Nation work together to manage the rich cultural and natural resources.
