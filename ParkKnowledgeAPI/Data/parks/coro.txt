Coronado National Memorial
State(s): AZ

Description:
It was a journey of conquest filled with exploration, wonder - and cruelty. Inspired by tales of vast cities of gold, 339 European soldiers and over a thousand Aztec allies embarked on an epic journey through arid deserts and rugged mountains. They encountered rich traditions and brought new technologies. The resulting collision and combination of cultures reverberates today.

Directions:
From the city of Sierra Vista continue south on Hwy 92 about 20 miles and turn right onto S. Coronado Memorial Drive. Follow Coronado Memorial Drive (it will turn into E Montezuma Canyon Rd) 5 miles to the Visitor Center.

Operating Hours:
Park: Coronado National Memorial is a day use park. The trails, picnic area, waysides, and Montezuma Pass overlook are open each day from one half hour before sunrise to one half hour after sunset.

Weather:
Though the park shares a border with our southern neighbors, the elevation and the mountain ecosystem keep Coronado National Memorial relatively cool in the summer, and winter can bring snow. Summers are warm, with daytime temps in the 90s F (32-37 C) and low humidity in May, June, and July. The summer rainy season (monsoon) is between late June and early September. Monsoon thunderstorms can cause flash floods. Winter temps can fall below freezing at night, with highs 40-60 F (4-15 C).
