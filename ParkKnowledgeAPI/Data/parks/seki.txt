Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks
State(s): CA

Description:
Huge mountains, rugged foothills, deep canyons, vast caverns, and the world’s largest trees exemplify the diversity of landscapes, life, and beauty here. Explore these pages to plan your visit or to learn about the plants and animals here and the threats they face. Ancient giant sequoias may seem invincible, but they, too are vulnerable.

Directions:
Two highways enter the parks. Hwy 180 from Fresno leads east to Kings Canyon National Park, then continues 30 miles east to Cedar Grove. Hwy 198 from Visalia leads east to Sequoia National Park via Three Rivers. Inside the parks, Highway 198 becomes the Generals Highway, which connects 198 to 180. Vehicles over 22-feet long should enter the parks via Highway 180. In winter, the Generals Highway between the parks often closes. Chains may be required on park roads. No roads cross the parks east to west.

Operating Hours:
Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks: The parks are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Some park roads and roads that access more remote parts of the parks close in the winter due to snow accumulation. Rarely, extreme weather conditions may cause roads into the parks to be closed.

Weather:
Because of the extreme elevation range in the parks, weather conditions vary widely between areas. In summer, the sequoia groves have comfortable temperatures and the foothills are hot and dry. Snow lingers on high-mountain passes well into summer. In fall, conditions can range from summer-like to winter-like. Winter brings snow to sequoia groves and rain to the foothills. Be prepared for tire chain requirements. Spring is a great time to hike in the foothills and snow begins to melt at higher elevations.
