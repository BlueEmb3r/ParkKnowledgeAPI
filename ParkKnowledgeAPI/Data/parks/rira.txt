River Raisin National Battlefield Park
State(s): MI

Description:
River Raisin NBP preserves, commemorates, and interprets the January 1813 battles of the War of 1812 and their aftermath. Battles that resulted in the greatest victory for Tecumseh’s Confederation and the British and the greatest defeat for the U.S. The aftermath led to U.S. Indian laws that forced the removal, relocation, and assimilation of native nations, an aftermath that continues today.
