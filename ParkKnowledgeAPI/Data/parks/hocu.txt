Hopewell Culture National Historical Park
State(s): OH

Description:
Nearly 2000 years ago, Native Americans built dozens of monumental mounds and earthen enclosures in southern Ohio. These earthwork complexes were ceremonial landscapes used for feasts, funerals, rituals, and rites of passage associated with a Native American religious movement that swept over half the continent for almost 400 years. Come walk among the earthworks and experience the past.
