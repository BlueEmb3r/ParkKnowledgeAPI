Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail
State(s): HI

Description:
Established in 2000 to preserve, protect and interpret traditional Native Hawaiian culture and natural resources, Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail is a 175-mile corridor encompassing a network of culturally and historically significant trails. This "trail by the sea" traverses wahi pana (storied landscapes), ancient Hawaiian sites and over 200 ahupuaʻa (traditional land divisions).

Directions:
Open sections of the Ala Kahakai NHT can be accessed through the four Hawai'i Island National Parks: Hawaiʻi Volcanoes NP, Pu'uhonua o Hōnaunau NHP, Kaloko-Honokōhau NHP and Pu'ukoholā Heiau NHS. The Nā Ala Hele State Trails and Access Programʻs "Ala Kahakai Trail" in South Kohala is also open to the public. Additional sections of the trail are opened as they are sufficiently managed to protect the trail and associated areas.

Operating Hours:
Ala Kahakai: Hours vary dependent on trail section.

Weather:
Hawaiʻiʻs coast is generally sunny and hot. Be prepared with sun protection (hat, mineral-based sunscreen, sunglasses and long sleeves) and water (minimum 2 liters of water per person per day for short hikes).
