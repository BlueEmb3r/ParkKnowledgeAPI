Jimmy Carter National Historical Park
State(s): GA

Description:
Few U.S. Presidents have had such close ties with where they were born and raised. The rural southern culture of Plains, Georgia revolves around farming, church, and school, which had a large influence in molding the character and shaping the political policies of the 39th President of the United States.

In Americus take US 280W/ W Forsyth St. until it becomes US-19 S/US-280 W/S Martin Luther King Blvd. Turn left and go .08 mile. Turn right onto US-280 W and travel 8.9 miles. Turn right onto North Bond Street/ Hwy 45 North. Plains High School Visitor Center and Museum will be on the right side of the road 500 feet from the intersection.

Operating Hours:
Plains Depot: Plains Depot was chosen for President Carter's 1976 Presidential Campaign Headquarters because it was vacant and it had a public restroom. Today the building is a museum for Jimmy Carter's campaign for Georgia State Senate, Governor of Georgia, and President of the United States.
Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm: Jimmy Carter's father, Earl Carter, moved the family to the community of Archery, Georgia when Jimmy Carter was 4 years old. He lived here until he went off to college. In 2000, the National Park Service opened up a restored Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm to the public.
