Blackwell School National Historic Site
State(s): TX

Description:
Written by prejudice rather than law, the story of the Blackwell School is one of “separate but equal” education for Mexican and Mexican American citizens of Marfa, Texas. Built in 1909, the school serves as a significant example of how racism and cultural disparity dominated education and social systems in the United States during this period of de facto segregation from 1889-1965.

Weather:
Marfa experiences long and hot summers from May – September. The winters are cold and windy with occasional light snow due to its elevation from November – February. Spring and fall offer pleasant temperatures and light rainfall.
