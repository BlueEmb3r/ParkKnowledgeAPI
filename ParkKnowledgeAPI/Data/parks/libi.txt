Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument
State(s): MT

Description:
This land is a place to honor and reflect on the sacrifices made here on June 25 and 26, 1876, when Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors fought against a deliberate attack by the U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry, led by Lt. Col. George Custer, who sought to enforce policies that threatened their traditional way of life. How are the results of the battle felt in the West and Indigenous communities today?
