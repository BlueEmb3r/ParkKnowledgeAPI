Governors Island National Monument
State(s): NY

Description:
From 1794 to 1966, the U.S. Army on Governors Island was part of the social, political, and economic tapestry of New York City. It was home to the US Coast Guard from 1966 to 1996. Today, the island is a vibrant venue of art, culture, and performance against the backdrop of two centuries of military heritage and the skyline of one of the great cities of the world. The island is open to the public.
