Fort Frederica National Monument
State(s): GA

Description:
War was imminent as James Oglethorpe established Fort Frederica in 1736, to help protect the British colonies from the Spanish in Florida. Fort Frederica illustrates the story of the War of Jenkins Ear (1739-1748) and how its British defenders fought off the Spanish Army. Today, archeology has uncovered the story of the 1,000 people that once lived here.

Bloody Marsh Site: Bloody Marsh is roughly where the site of the last battle of the Spanish invasion of Georgia took place on July 7th. Though casualties were relatively light, it would rob the Spanish of their enthusiasm and lead to their abandonment of their campaign. Located 7 miles south from the front gates of the town of Frederica, this relatively minor engagement ended the Spanish threat to the Georgia colonies.
Visitor Center Hours: The Visitor Center is closed Monday and Tuesday. The park grounds remain open for visitation.

Weather:
The site enjoys mild climate from fall through early summer, followed by hot, humid summers.
