John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site
State(s): MA

Description:
JFK’s parents never expected that their second son would grow up to be president. Yet in his birthplace home he learned values that inspired a life in public service. His mother, Rose Kennedy, recreated her family’s first home to share her memories of those early years with visitors. We commemorate not only his early life, but the ideas and principles he left behind.
