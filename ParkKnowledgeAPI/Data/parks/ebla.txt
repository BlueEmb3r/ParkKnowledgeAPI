Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve
State(s): WA

Description:
This stunning landscape on the Salish Sea, with its rich farmland and promising seaport, lured the earliest American pioneers north of the Columbia River to Ebey’s Landing. Today Ebey’s Landing National Historical Reserve preserves the historical, agricultural and cultural traditions of both Native and Euro-American – while offering spectacular opportunities for recreation.

Directions:
Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve is on Whidbey Island in the Puget Sound. The island is easily accessible from the mainland by vehicle via Washington State Route 20 from Burlington and aboard the Washington State Ferries from either Mukilteo or Port Townsend.

Operating Hours:
Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve: The Reserve is over 80% privately owned, contains three Washington State Parks, and the historic town of Coupeville. There are no hours or fees for visiting the Reserve, but individual business and parks within the Reserve set their own hours.
Jacob and Sarah Ebey House: The historic Jacob & Sarah Ebey House and the Ebey Blockhouse are open to the public during the summer months, Thursdays through Sundays, from 10am to 4pm.
Administrative Office: The administrative offices located in the Cottage at Sunnyside are open from 9 to 5,  Monday through Friday.

Weather:
Fall and Winter often bring blustery and rainy weather, and while winter storm watching might be fun from the many beaches within the Reserve, it's important to watch for high waves and logs coming ashore. Always dress appropriately for the weather, which can change suddenly from warm to chilly very quickly.
