Aniakchak National Monument & Preserve
State(s): AK

Description:
Given its remote location and challenging weather conditions, Aniakchak is one of the most wild and least visited places in the National Park System. This landscape is a vibrant reminder of Alaska's location in the volcanically active "Ring of Fire," as it is home to an impressive six mile (10 km) wide, 2,500 ft (762 m) deep caldera formed during a massive volcanic eruption 3,500 years ago.

Directions:
Located on the Alaska Peninsula, 450 miles southwest of Anchorage, Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve is inaccessible by road. Notoriously bad weather makes access to Aniakchak unpredictable. Drop-offs and/or pick-ups may be significantly delayed.

Operating Hours:
Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve: Aniakchak National Monument is a truly primitive environment with no federally-maintained public facilities. The NPS imposes no operating hours or seasonal restrictions. Access to and movement within Aniachak, however, may be limited or restricted at any time depending upon prevailing weather conditions.

Weather:
When you visit, be prepared to encounter all types of weather. On average, wet and cool conditions predominate in spring, summer, and fall. Strong winds can delay the departure and arrival of boats and floatplanes.
