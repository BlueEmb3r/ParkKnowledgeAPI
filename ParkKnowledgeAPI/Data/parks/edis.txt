Thomas Edison National Historical Park
State(s): NJ

Description:
Today, the brick buildings on Main Street in West Orange, NJ seem quiet, betraying little evidence of the research, development, and innovation of their heyday. Visitors can step back in time to Thomas Edison’s home and laboratory, when machines were run by belts and pulleys and music was played on phonographs. Discover where America’s greatest inventor changed our world forever.
