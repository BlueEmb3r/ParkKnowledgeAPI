Virgin Islands National Park
State(s): VI

Description:
Go beyond Virgin Islands National Park's stunning white-sand beaches. Hike to historic plantation sites to learn about a challenging past when sugar and enslaved labor dominated life on the island. Visit the Indigenous Taino's ancient petroglyphs. Snorkel coral reefs to discover hidden marine life. Two-thirds of the island of St. John is national park, making it a unique destination for visitors.

Directions:
There are no airports on St. John so you must fly to the St. Thomas Cyril E. King Airport (code STT) and travel from there. From the airport you rent a car and drive or take a taxi to Redhook (west end) St. Thomas. From there you can either take a car barge to St. John or the people ferry. Once on St. John you can easily walk from the ferry terminal to the Visitor Center.

Operating Hours:
Virgin Islands National Park Visitor Center: Virgin Islands National Park is always open! The Visitor Center and store are open from 8:15 a.m. until 4 p.m. Monday - Thursday and 8:15 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. on Fridays. It is closed on weekends, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

Weather:
Mostly Perfect! The Tradewinds (the Easterlies) dominate the weather in the Virgin Islands, blowing east to west across the tropical Atlantic. The winter tends to bring stronger winds and less rain, and the summer tends to bring more rain and lighter winds. Be sure to check the forecast often during hurricane season or winter swell events.
