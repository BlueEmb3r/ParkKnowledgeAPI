Fort Pulaski National Monument
State(s): GA

Description:
For much of the 19th century, masonry fortifications were the United States’ main defense against overseas enemies. However, during the Civil War, new technology proved its superiority over these forts. Using rifled cannons, the U.S. Army compelled the Confederate garrison inside Fort Pulaski to surrender. The siege was a landmark experiment in the history of military science and invention.
