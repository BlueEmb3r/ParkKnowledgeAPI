The famous San Francisco fog begins rolling in through the Golden Gate in the spring and can persist throughout the summer months. That said, the city can be foggy and windy any time of the year, so if your visit to “sunny California” includes a stop in San Francisco, bring some warm clothing. The average annual temperature is 62.5°F (16.9°C).
