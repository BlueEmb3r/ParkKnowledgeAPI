Coltsville National Historical Park
State(s): CT

Description:
When Samuel Colt started his Hartford factory on the banks of the Connecticut River in 1847, it followed years of mismanagement and failure. Soon, demand for Colt's revolver would change his fortunes and the Colt empire was born. Following Colt's untimely death in 1862, his wife, Elizabeth Colt, would lead the company to its legendary status, and influence Hartford for over 40 years.
