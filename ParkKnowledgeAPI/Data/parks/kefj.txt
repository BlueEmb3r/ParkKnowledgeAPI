Kenai Fjords National Park
State(s): AK

Description:
At the edge of the Kenai Peninsula lies a land where the ice age lingers. Nearly 40 glaciers flow from the Harding Icefield, Kenai Fjords' crowning feature. Wildlife thrives in icy waters and lush forests along the fjords once carved by the vast expanse of ice. Today, shrinking glaciers bear witness to the effects of our changing climate.

Directions:
Kenai Fjords National Park is located just outside the town of Seward in south-central Alaska, 126 miles south of Anchorage. Even though the park is often inaccessible during the winter months, Seward is accessible year-round via the Seward Highway, a National Scenic Byway. Follow the Seward Highway (AK-1) south from Anchorage. It will become AK-9 around mile 35 (87 miles from Anchorage) with AK-1 heading to Homer and Kenai. Continue on AK-9 to Seward.

Operating Hours:
Open Year-Round: The park is open year-round.  The primary months to visit are June, July, and August.  There are reduced services in the area during the months of May and September.

The road to the Exit Glacier area is not plowed during the winter months, and is closed to vehicle traffic once it is covered in snow and ice.

The park's coastal backcountry in also largely inaccessible late fall through the early spring due to rough seas.

Weather:
The weather in Kenai Fjords is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The area generally enjoys a relatively temperate maritime climate, primarily due to the influence of warmer ocean currents that flows through the Gulf of Alaska. Summer daytime temperatures range from the mid 40s°F to the low 70s°F. Overcast and cool rainy days are frequent. Winter temperatures can range from the low 30s°F to -20°F.
