Thomas Cole National Historic Site
State(s): NY

Description:
In 1825, America was still a new nation, just forming its own unique identity and traditions. Thomas Cole invented a new style of art, one that Americans could call their own. His landscape paintings launched the art movement known as the Hudson River School. His groundbreaking achievements took place here in Catskill, New York -- in the "peaceful shades" of his beloved home, Cedar Grove.
