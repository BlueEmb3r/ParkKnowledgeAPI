Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument
State(s): AZ

Description:
Despite the hardships created by rugged isolation and the lack of natural waters, Parashant has a long human history spanning more than 11,000 years, and an equally rich geologic history spanning almost two billion years. Full of natural splendor and a sense of solitude, this area remains remote and unspoiled, qualities that are essential to the protection of its scientific and historic resources.
