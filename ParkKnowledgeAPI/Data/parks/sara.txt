Saratoga National Historical Park
State(s): NY

Description:
In 1777, a large British invasion force met an equally large American army here at Saratoga. After two intense battles, an eight-mile retreat, and a three-day siege, British General John Burgoyne surrendered his entire force. This first ever surrender of a British Army is one of the pivotal moments in determining the outcome of the Revolutionary War, forever changing the future of the world.

After retreating north from Saratoga Battlefield, the British Army moved west to a ridge top where they made their final defense.  Surrounded and nearly out of food, ammunition, and time, they surrendered to the Americans on October 17, 1777.
